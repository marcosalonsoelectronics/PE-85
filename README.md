Material of video PE-85: Understanding MOSFET Parasitic Capacitance Characteristics

Available at: https://youtu.be/o8RUQa1i3Wc

In this video we talk about MOSFET parasitic capacitances. The typical parasitic capacitance characteristics provided by the manufacturers are explained. An introduction to non-linear capacitances is also presented. The video also shows how to plot the MOSFET parasitic capacitance characteristics by simulation. Simulation results are provided using Qspice.
